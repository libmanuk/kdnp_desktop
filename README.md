# kdnp_desktop
Set of Windows desktop tools (DOS and Bash) for generating various metadata for the Kentucky Digital Newspaper Program.

Some of these scripts use both ImageMagick (https://www.imagemagick.org/) for Windows and PDFtk (https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) for Windows from the DOS commandline.

These scripts require the use of Cygwin or Gow within Windows OS.
